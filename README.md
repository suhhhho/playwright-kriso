### Useful commands

```bash
# Interactive UI mode (recommended during development)
npx playwright test --ui

# Headed mode — watch the browser
npx playwright test --headed

# Run only a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/flat/cart.spec.ts

# Record new tests against Kriso
npx playwright codegen https://www.kriso.ee

# View the HTML report after a run
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Cases

### Task 1 — Flat Tests (`tests/flat/`)

#### Search for Books by Keywords

| Steps | Expected Result (Assertions) |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Open https://www.kriso.ee | Confirm the page has a Kriso title/logo |
| Search for keyword "harry potter" | Confirm multiple products are shown |
| | All listed items contain the searched keyword in their title or description |
| | Products can be sorted |
| Sort results by price | Verify products are sorted in the expected order (e.g., low to high or high to low) |
| Filter by language (e.g., English) | Verify only products in that language appear |
| Filter by format (e.g., "Kõvakaaneline" / hardback) | Confirm fewer items are listed and all match the selected format |

#### Add Books to Shopping Cart

| Steps | Expected Result (Assertions) |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Open https://www.kriso.ee | Confirm the page has a Kriso title/logo |
| Search for any keyword | Confirm multiple results are shown |
| | Products can be added to the shopping cart |
| Add one book to the cart | Confirm the cart shows 1 item |
| Add a second book | Confirm the cart updates to show 2 items |
| Click the cart/checkout icon | Confirm the user is navigated to the cart view |
| | Verify cart contains 2 correct items |
| | Verify the total price is accurate |
| Remove the first item from cart | Confirm the cart now shows 1 item |
| | Confirm the correct item was removed |
| | Verify the total price updates accordingly |

#### Navigate Products via Filters

| Steps | Expected Result (Assertions) |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Open https://www.kriso.ee | Confirm the page has a Kriso title/logo |
| Scroll down to find a section like "Muusikaraamatud ja noodid" | Confirm the section is visible |
| Click the "Õppematerjalid" category | Verify that there are more than 1 products found |
| | Confirm URL or page title reflects navigation correctly |
| Click on a category ("Bänd ja ansambel") | Confirm active filters show the selected category |
| | Verify products list now contains less items |
| Click on a format category ("CD") | Confirm active filters show the selected category |
| | Verify products list now contains less items |

### Task 2 — Page Object Model (`tests/pom/`)

Refactor your Task 1 tests to use the Page Object Model:

- All locators and actions live in page classes under `pages/` — no raw selectors in test files
- `cart.pom.spec.ts` uses `beforeAll` + `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` because the tests share state (items added in one test are verified in the next)
- `search.pom.spec.ts` and `filters.pom.spec.ts` use fixtures from `tests/fixtures.ts` — import `test` from there instead of `@playwright/test`

---

### Task 3 — CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`)

Complete the scaffolded workflow file so your tests run automatically in the cloud on every push and pull request.

**The pipeline must:**

- Trigger on push to `main` and on pull requests targeting `main`
- Run on a Linux machine
- Install Node.js and npm dependencies
- Install the Playwright browser binaries
- Execute all tests
- Upload the HTML report as an artifact (even when tests fail)

Open `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` — each step has a `# TODO` comment explaining what to add. Fill in the blanks, push, then open the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to confirm the run goes green.

> **Submitting:** copy the URL of the passing Actions run and paste it into your Pull Request description.
